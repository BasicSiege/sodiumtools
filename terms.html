            <p>We are Sodium ("Company," "we," "us," "our"), a website and bot that servers on the platform Discord. Any reference to Sodium in this document refers to both our website and the bot hosted on Discord. By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

            <p>You can contact us for support by emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@sodium.tools" class="email-link">help@sodium.tools</a></p>

            <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and Sodium, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>

            <h3>1. Our services</h3>

            <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
</p>

            <p>The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
