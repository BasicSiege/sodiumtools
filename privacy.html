            All collected data except for message content data is used in our database of known scammers to help keep Discord a safe place. This data is only collected when our database is being modified by a user, which can only be done by certain trusted members, meaning not everyone has tha ability to modify our database.

Server data is automatically removed when Guardify is removed from the server.

            Message content is not stored at all and is used purely for an alternative to application commands. Not all application commands are available as normal message commands.
            <br><br>
            Server IDs, names, and invites are only collected when a server moderator decides to modify our database, and this data can be requested to be deleted at our support email below. This server data is removed when Guardify is removed from the server.
            <br><br>
            All of this non-sensitive information contributes to our publicly accessible DWC database by Guardify through commands to check a user's status to ensure transparency.
